### I'm an immunologist/biochemist who works with a computer rather than a lab bench.
- As a scientist, I use computational tools/methods to study pathological immune cells.
- Lately, I've become progressively more interested in machine/deep learning & the design of systems that leverage the power of those tools.
- Most of my development experience has been with the core data science langauges (Python, R, SQL), but I've recently been looking into learning Rust.
