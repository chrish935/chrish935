### Biochemist turned bioinformatician.
- As a scientist, I use computational tools/methods to study pathological immune cells.
- I'm interested in machine/deep learning & the design of systems that leverage the power of those tools.
- I mainly use the core data science langauges (Python, R, SQL), but I've recently been teaching myself Rust.
