### I'm an immunologist/biochemist who does most of his science from behind a keyboard.
- As a scientist, I use computational tools/methods to study pathological immune cells.
- Lately, I've become more & more interested in machine/deep learning.
- I'm slowly but surely working towards becoming a data scientist.
